    <h1>Things I need to do</h1>
    <!-- We can render the items key from the context dictionary that we just created
using this double curly bracket syntax.
This is called a template variable and anything that you return to the template
in that dictionary can be rendered in the same way. 
That includes almost anything that you can use in Python
Meaning you can return strings, numbers, lists, other dictionaries, or even functions and classes. -->
    <!-- {{ items }} -->
<!-- A query set is kind of like a list which means we can iterate through it in our
template just like we could iterate through a list in Python. 
If we go back to the file.
We can adjust the syntax slightly to turn it into a loop that will iterate through our items-->
    <table>
        {% for item in items %}
        <tr>
            <!-- if block inside loop -->
            {% if item.done %}
                <td><strike>{{ item.name }}</strike></td>
            {% else %}
                <td>{{ item.name }}</td>
            {% endif %}
        <!-- In this video we'll give it the ability to edit existing items.
        To do that the first thing we need is a button next to each item that will take us to the Edit item page.
        In the todo list.html template.
        I'll render a new td element in each row which contains a link with a button in it.
        -->
            <td>
                <!-- The href on the link will point to a new URL we'll create in a moment edit.
And we'll also append the items ID which is automatically generated by Django. -->
                <a href="/edit/{{ item.id}}">
                    <button>Edit</button>
                </a>
            </td>
            <td>
                <a href="/toggle/{{ item.id}}">
                    <button>Toggle</button>
                </a>
            </td>
            <td>
                <a href="/delete/{{ item.id}}">
                    <button>Delete</button>
                </a>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <!-- There's one last thing i'd like to add here and that's to handle what should
happen if our database doesn't have any todo items in it.
To handle that we can use a special tag called empty. Right before the endfor tag.
After the empty tag all we want to do is render a single row.
With a single td element in it. Which says you have nothing to do. -->
        {% empty %}
        <tr><td>You have nothing to do</td></tr>

        {% endfor %}
